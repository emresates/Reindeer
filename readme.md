## Reindeer Winter Resort Page

### Today I designed the web page of a winter resort where we can go on vacation in winter.  I used html, scss,  vanilla.js, gsap.js and slider.js while making this project. Hope you like it.

### When we open the page for the first time, we see an opening effect. There is a navbar on the left. There is a transition effect for each page. 

### The "Watch Trailer" button on the right brings up a youtube video. When we click anywhere on the page, the video turns off.

### When we scroll on the gallery page, the photos start to scroll. The current number is written on each photo.

### A form greets us on the contact page. There's also a suitable photo in the background
